# NZ_SARS-CoV-2_genomics

## Creating a narrative for Aotearoa
A collaborative space where NZ researchers come together to better understand the virus that causes COVID-19.

### Positive samples
We are asking all testing facilities across the country to send their positive samples to ESR to enable the sequencing of the genome.
Without these samples and the hard work of the testing labs none of this would be possible.

### Genomics assisted Epidemiological analysis
We have several teams working on analysing these and other data to inform New Zealandâ€™s response to the pandemic.
- Identify potential sources of infection 
- Study the transmission rate into NZ from overseas
- Evaluate the disease severity across lineages
- Determine the R0 of the epidemic within NZ
- Measure transmission rate between regions of NZ
- Understand types of human movements that drive transmission between the regions of NZ
